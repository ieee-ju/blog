What is the first thing that comes to our mind when we say the word ‘technology’? 

It’s mostly industry, automation, circuits, computers - but we often tend to overlook the little ways in which it has affected our lives directly, how it is changing our lives for the better, day by day. Since time immemorial, without us being aware of it, technology has contributed to the lives of women - be it handcrafted jewellery or embroidered sarees. As the world celebrates the International Working Woman's Day, let us take some time to appreciate how technology has managed to transcend all barriers imposed by nature upon women with the invention of a simple sanitary pad.

In the last few decades, the sanitary napkins' industry has achieved milestones with low cost and better designed pads, keeping in mind women’s comfort. Prior to its invention, indiscriminate use of unhygienic rags and cloths for dealing with ‘that time of the month’ would often lead to infections. This simple invention has facilitated women’s outdoor lives by helping them overcome their natural ‘handicap’ and embark on journeys which were hitherto considered ‘‘a man’s world’’! However, there still exist places in our country where women do not have access to sanitary napkins, where every day becomes a struggle for them. We hope there comes a time when every woman gets to use what.
