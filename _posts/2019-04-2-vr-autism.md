Playing games in virtual reality is one immersive experience! But what if VR also helps people with neurological disorders such as 'autism'?

The ability to estimate the passage of time with precision is fundamental to our ability to interact with the world, but for some individuals, the internal clock is maladjusted, causing timing deficiencies that affect perception and action. This is what we call 'Autism'.People who suffer from this face innumerable difficulties in their daily life. A research was conducted with18 females and 13 males with normal vision and no sensory, musculoskeletal or neurological disorders. The researchers used a virtual reality game, Robo Recall, to create a natural setting in which to encourage re-calibration of time perception. The researchers coupled the speed and duration of visual events to the participants' body movements. They measured participants’ time perception abilities before and after they were exposed to the dynamic VR task. It was found that virtual reality manipulation was associated with significant reductions in the participants’ estimates of time, by around 15 per cent. According to Seamas Weech, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Waterloo in Canada, "For developing clinical applications, we need to know whether these effects are stable for minutes, days, or weeks afterward. A longitudinal study would provide the answer to this question". Further research in this field will definitely be a gift to these special people making their life a little easier!
