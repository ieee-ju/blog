The Google Summer of Code is perhaps the dream of every open source programmer. There couldn't possibly be a better way than to code away your summer at a dream organization, in a dream country, with the best minds as your mentors. With about six months to go before applications open, this might seem too early to talk about GSoC. But when you're up against the best in the game, it might be a smart idea to start planning early. Here are five things you should know and remember if you're ready to dream big. Happy coding!

P. S. If you have queries, ask away! Post your question in the comment box, we'll be happy to help.
