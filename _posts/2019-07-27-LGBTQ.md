Gender fluidity isn't rocket science, yet it seems to be the most difficult concept to grasp today. Perhaps the key to being aware of the gender spectrum is simply to be a little more open and inclusive. Not knowing isn't a crime, but not wanting to know definitely is.
Tinder, one of the most-used apps of today took a beautiful measure to make it a safer place for the LGBTQ community. With its new safety update called the 'Traveler Alert', the app will now use the user's device location to check if they are in a country that can criminalize them for being open about their sexual preferences. The users will be notified and can choose to hide certain sections of their profile as long as they are in that country.
Such a simple measure, but such a huge step towards recognising individual identities and caring for their safety.
