5G offers at least a tenfold improvement in network performance. 5G is poised to deliver peak speeds between 10 and 20 Gbps. And network latency will drop from 30ms to about 1ms, ideal for video game streaming, online video, and the Internet of Things, which is anticipating 5G to connect sensors, computers, and other devices with ultra-low latency.
Spectral efficiency is “the optimized use of spectrum or bandwidth so that the maximum amount of data can be transmitted with the fewest transmission errors.” It should have a slightly improved spectral efficiency over LTE, coming in at 30bits/Hz downlink, and 15 bits/Hz uplink.
5G should also be able to support many more connected devices than LTE. The standard states it should be able to support 1 million connected devices per square kilometre. That’s a huge number, which takes into account the slew of devices that will power the Internet of Things (IoT). #5g #network #networklatency #internetofthings #iot #videogames #streaming #spectrum #bandwidth #transmission #lte #connectiondensity #futureofspeed #futureisnow #hyperprobe #jadavpuruniversity #ieeeinitiative #ieee
