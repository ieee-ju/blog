Yesterday, we celebrated the lives of women. What today, and the rest of the days of the year hold for the millions of ordinary women with extraordinary lives is something we aren't very sure about. This week, we shall celebrate the lives of Women in Science and Technology, the often unsung heroes behind several revolutionary works in their fields. We'll be bringing to you a story every day, and all that we hope for is to inspire atleast one woman out there, help her dream, nudge her forward with stories that are very real.
Behind the historical event of the landing on the moon on 16th july ’69, quite surprisingly for that time, it wasn’t just the men who were at work. Women were more than instrumental in that epic feat than humanity celebrated. Among the few women was Katherine Johnson, the “computer” that NASA hired for the calculations required to reach the moon. Her inclination towards Maths was apparent since childhood and she graduated college at 18. But for an African-American woman to join NASA (then NACA), it required more than just being good at Math. She joined NACA in her second attempt and became one of the first woman scientists NASA ever had. Katherine studied the use of geometry for space travel. She figured out the paths for the spacecrafts to orbit the Earth and to land on the moon. Later, her math helped send astronauts to the Moon and back.
Although Katherine died this February, she continues to be a powerful symbol of woman empowerment. Her love and dedication towards mathematics helped her defy the prevalent social constructs. Till today, she has remained an inspiration for women across the world. She shall be remembered forever as a true “American Hero”.
