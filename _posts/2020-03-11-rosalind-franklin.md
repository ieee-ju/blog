Whether it's the technology that allows us to peer deep into the body or medicines that extend the lives of those with chronic diseases, it's easy to see how advances in health and medicine have touched the lives of nearly every person on the planet.
But even after an enormous progress in recent decades, women still have to deal with biases against them in the sciences.
We, members of the IEEE JU student body bring forth one such crowning achievement of a woman chemist that went largely unrecognised.
Rosalind Elsie Franklin was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).She made a crucial contribution to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA.
Few years later Maurice Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Watson and Crick for discovering the spiralling ladder structure of DNA and its role in heredity. Franklin, whose lab produced the photograph that helped unravel the mystery of DNA, received no credit for her role until after her death.
