As we continue to walk down the path of celebrating women and their contribution in science, we cannot ignore Patricia E. Bath, the inventor of laserphaco surgery for cataract.
Patricia was born to a motorman and a housewife in New York on November 4th, 1942. She had always been a bright child, and at the age of 16 she attended a workshop on cancer research and her discoveries there were published in a scientific paper by Dr. Bernard, earning Bath the Mademoiselle magazine's Merit Award in 1960.
She was a humanitarian and was of the belief that vision was the basic right of every individual. She attended the Howard University to pursue a medical degree, completing her master's in ophthalmology from University of Columbia.
Patricia Bath became the first African-American to complete a residency in ophthalmology, the first female faculty member in the UCLA Jules Stein Eye Institute's Department of Ophthalmology, the first U.S. woman to serve as the chair of an ophthalmology residency training program, and the first ever African-American female doctor to receive a patent for a medical invention.
It was her deep passion and love for humanity that led her to become a physician and we continue to celebrate her legacy by remembering her today.
