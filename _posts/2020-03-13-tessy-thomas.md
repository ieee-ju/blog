Much as we say that it is difficult to find women making an impact in the field of science and innovation closer home, Tessy Thomas has been a trailblazer, a glaring example to prove us wrong. Tessy, or 'Agni Putri' as she is commonly known, is a celebrated missile scientist - the first woman to be appointed as DRDO's Director General, Aeronautics Systems. In 2010, she was the project director of the Agni-4, making history as the first woman scientist to head an important missile project, not just in India but in the entire world. She is the designer of the guidance scheme for long range missile systems which is used in all Agni missiles. A recipient of many presitigious awards, the Missile Woman of India is an inspiration for millions of women in our country.
